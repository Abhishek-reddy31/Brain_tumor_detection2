# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection System

Welcome to the Brain Tumor Detection System repository! This project leverages machine learning to identify brain tumors from MRI images, utilizing a custom-built neural network model. The system is built with Flask for a web-based interface and TensorFlow/Keras for model training and prediction.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The Brain Tumor Detection System allows users to upload MRI images of the brain and get a prediction about the presence of a tumor. The system is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, providing accurate results in real-time.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Flask**: For creating the web application
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For model building and training
- **Python**: The programming language used
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations
- **OpenCV**: For image processing
- **HTML/CSS**: For creating the web interface

## 🌟 Features

- **Real-time Predictions**: Upload an MRI image and receive instant results on whether a brain tumor is detected.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive web interface for easy interaction.
- **Contact Form**: Users can send feedback or inquiries through a contact form.
